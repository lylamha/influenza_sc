# Analysis of intracellular viral defective RNAs affecting the viral reproduction in influenza viruses

This repository includes the computational analysis of the manuscript by Kupke, Ly, Boerno et. al.

### 01_sc_analysis
The notebook contains the comparison of host and viral gene expression between high and low productive cells on a single cells resolution. Quality filtering was performed in beforehand filtering out cells with a low library size (< 10000 reads) and a low ERCC accuracy (< 0.75). Data will be provided as soon as the manuscript is published.

### 02_h1n1_deleted_mrna
The notebook includes the analysis of deleted mRNA regions occured on H1N1 segments 1,2,3. 
We compare insert sizes as an indicator of the presence of defective RNAs and detect breaking points by using chimeric read information.
